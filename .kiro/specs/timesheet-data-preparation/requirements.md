# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Timesheet Data Preparation Tool is a simple web-based interface that allows users to upload CSV files containing timesheet data (with columns for "Tracked by Name", "Billable", and "Sum"), add date range information during upload, and download a processed CSV file with month and year columns added to each row. The tool will be delivered as a single HTML file for easy deployment and use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to upload a CSV file and specify a date range, so that I can add temporal context to my timesheet data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the tool THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface with date range inputs
2. WHEN the user selects a CSV file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is in CSV format
3. WHEN the user specifies a date range THEN the system SHALL capture the month and year from the selected dates
4. WHEN an invalid file type is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent processing
5. WHEN both file and date range are provided THEN the system SHALL enable the processing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to process my timesheet CSV by adding month and year columns, so that I can easily concatenate multiple files later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user initiates processing THEN the system SHALL parse the uploaded CSV file
2. WHEN the CSV is parsed THEN the system SHALL preserve all original columns ("Tracked by Name", "Billable", "Sum")
3. WHEN processing occurs THEN the system SHALL add "Month" and "Year" columns to each row based on the provided date range
4. WHEN the date range is applied THEN each row SHALL receive the same month and year values from the form submission
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the original data structure with additional date columns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to download the processed data with a standardized filename, so that I can easily identify processed files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download button for the processed data
2. WHEN the user clicks download THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file with the original data plus month and year columns
3. WHEN the download occurs THEN the filename SHALL follow the pattern "<original_filename>_processed.csv"
4. WHEN the original filename was "data.csv" THEN the processed file SHALL be named "data_processed.csv"
5. WHEN the CSV is downloaded THEN it SHALL be properly formatted and compatible with standard analysis tools

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to preview the processed data before download, so that I can verify the month and year were added correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the processed data
2. WHEN the preview is shown THEN it SHALL display the first few rows with all columns including the added Month and Year
3. WHEN the user reviews the preview THEN they SHALL be able to see that each row has the correct month and year values
4. WHEN the preview is displayed THEN it SHALL show the total number of rows processed
5. WHEN the data is previewed THEN the original column structure SHALL be preserved with the new date columns appended

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to be delivered as a single HTML file, so that it can be easily deployed and shared without complex setup requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is developed THEN it SHALL be contained within a single HTML file
2. WHEN the HTML file is opened in a web browser THEN all functionality SHALL work without external dependencies
3. WHEN the tool runs THEN it SHALL not require server-side processing or database connections
4. WHEN the file is shared THEN it SHALL work on different operating systems and modern web browsers
5. WHEN the tool is used THEN all processing SHALL occur client-side for data privacy and security
